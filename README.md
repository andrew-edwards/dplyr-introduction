# Introduction to the R package dplyr

**Andrew Edwards, Pacific Biological Station.**

**For 'Advanced R users workshop', Pacific Biological Station, Thursday 18th February 2016.**

To save the code and data (and this file) just click 'Download ZIP' in the top-right corner. If something does not work then let me know and I will update the code.

If you use GitHub then feel free to fork and commit updates! 

Files are:

**dummyData.RData** - dummy data set, based on a set of longline survey data. Values have been generated, and so are not the original data; the data set is just for illustration of the dplyr packageR .

**dplyr-introduction.r** - R file to demonstrate some of the features of dplyr. Step through it one line at a time; i.e. do not just do **source("dplyr-introduction.r")** like you would normally with code.

**README.md** - this file that you are reading. It should be readable on the website, but maybe not on your laptop. Just paste it into a .txt file and view in an editor. 

**.gitignore** - if you don't know what this is then just ignore it. 

If something doesn't work or requires more explanation (likely!) then let me know and I can update the code on this site. If I had more time then I could have created  simpler example code, but it was quicker to adapt what I already had. 

There are tutorials on the web. One by Sean Anderson that has info about the chaining %>% command is:

I think he had an earlier version that I first learnt from, but I can't see it right now.
